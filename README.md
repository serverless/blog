## How to add Author Information

The name of the file should be the same as the name field used in the blog post meta data. Format: `FirstnameLastname` (note the caps and no space!)

Example `authors/DavidWells.json` and `DavidWells` in the `authors` field below are the same name and capitalization.

```yml
---
layout: Post
title: David's Amazing Post
authors:
 - DavidWells # references data in authors/DavidWells.json file
---
```

## Including Custom Scripts

**Note:** For security purposes, all scripts referenced are vetted and hosted via our s3 bucket.

If you need to include a custom script for demo purposes, you will need to send the script over to us for review.

```yml
# blog post frontmatter
layout: Post
title: David's Amazing Post
scripts:
  - https://link-to-custom-js-in-s3-bucket.js
  - http://link-to-custom-js-two-in-s3-bucket.js
inlineJS: |
  console.log('hi')
  console.log('this is a multiline inline JS that will run in the post')
```
