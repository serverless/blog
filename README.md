---

### 2. Name your post file name

`YYYY-MM-DD-blog-post-name.md` :point_right: `2016-01-27-post-title-here.md`**

> [handy tool for slugifying titles](https://blog.tersmitten.nl/slugify/)

---

### 3. In your post, include post meta information:

Include the post metadata at the top:


```
---
title: My awesome post title
description: "This post is about awesome stuff!"
date: 2016-07-25
thumbnail: 'http://url-to-thumbnail.jpg'
layout: Post
authors:
  - FirstnameLastname
---
```

Below the post meta, add your markdown:

<pre>
# Post Heading

This is an awesome paragraph!

## Post SubSection

[Link example](http://my-full-url-with-http-at-the-front.com)

* List item 1
* List item 2
* List item 3

```js
// code snippet example with javascript (js) syntax highlighting
console.log('JS code')
```
</pre>

---

### 4. Add your author bio

If you haven't created an author bio in the `/authors` folder. Go ahead and do that now.

The name of the file should be the same as the name field used in the blog post meta data. Format: `FirstnameLastname` (note the caps and no space!)

Example `authors/DavidWells.json` and `DavidWells` in the `authors` field below are the same name and capitalization.

```yml
---
layout: Post
title: David's Amazing Post
authors:
 - DavidWells # references data in authors/DavidWells.json file
---
```

title: David's Amazing Post
scripts:
  - https://link-to-custom-js-in-s3-bucket.js
