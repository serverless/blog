Today, we are excited to announce the general availability of Tencent Serverless Framework, a special edition of the Serverless Framework powered by Tencent Cloud, and designed exclusively for the Chinese developer community.
With this release we are also announcing several new features, and an overall world-class experience for zero-friction serverless application development.  Continue reading to see what is included in the GA release, join our webinar if you’d like to learn how to use these new features, or get started by building a [Serverless Function](https://github.com/serverless-components/tencent-scf), [Serverless Express.js] (https://github.com/serverless-components/tencent-express) application or [Serverless Website] (https://github.com/serverless-components/tencent-website) via the new Tencent Serverless Framework.

## New Application Experiences
Tencent Serverless Framework provides easy and powerful functionality for use-cases that are ideal to run on serverless infrastructure.  This functionality is called Serverless Framework Components.
Components helps developers deploy applications on serverless cloud infrastructure—without requiring a lot of knowledge about the infrastructure.
For example, developers can use the [Serverless Express.js Component] (https://github.com/serverless-components/tencent-express) to automatically deploy their Express.js applications onto Tencent Serverless Cloud Functions and API Gateway, so that they can make Express.js based APIs that scale massively and only incur charges when run.
Developers can also use Components to easily build [serverless websites] (https://github.com/serverless-components/tencent-website), [functions] (https://github.com/serverless-components/tencent-scf), and [much more] (https://github.com/serverless/components).

## Instant Deployments
When it comes to development, speed is the killer feature.
Tencent Serverless Framework is now powered by an innovative Cloud Engine, which performs all deployments, and reduces total deployment time to under 8 seconds.  Now, developers can push changes to the cloud as fast as possible.

With instant deployments, it becomes much easier to develop directly on real cloud services, rather than maintain a local emulation of those services.  This enables developers to work on the same cloud infrastructure their applications will use in production, avoiding unanticipated issues in their production environments, without compromising on development velocity.

## Real-Time Logging & Live Debugging
Getting logs and debugging live cloud services (e.g. Functions-as-a-Service) has previously been slow and difficult.
To solve this, Tencent Serverless Framework features a new “Dev Mode”, which developers can use to stream logs and errors from cloud services to their CLI, in real-time.
“Dev Mode” also features a live debugging feature, so developers can step through their code, and examine or modify its state to help track down bugs.

With instant deployments, real-time logging and live debugging, Tencent Serverless Framework enables developers to work directly on live cloud infrastructure, through an experience that looks and feels local.

## Try It, It’s Free!
Tencent Serverless Framework is now the fastest and easiest solution available for building serverless applications.  Best of all, it’s free to use.
Get started by building a [Serverless Function](https://github.com/serverless-components/tencent-scf), [Serverless Express.js] (https://github.com/serverless-components/tencent-express) application or [Serverless Website] (https://github.com/serverless-components/tencent-website), and join us in our upcoming webinar to learn how to use all of these great new features.
