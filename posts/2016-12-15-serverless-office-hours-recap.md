Serverless Office Hours is a monthly live chat with core members of the Serverless team. In the 2nd episode of Office Hours, Developer Evangelist [David Wells](https://github.com/DavidWells) and Core Framework Engineer [Eslam Hefnawy](https://github.com/eahefnawy) reviewed Lambda announcements from AWS re:Invent and talked about new features in Severless Framework [v1.2](https://serverless.com/blog/serverless-v1.2.0/) & [v1.3](https://serverless.com/blog/serverless-v1.3.0/) (now with [Environment Variables Support](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/functions/#environment-variables), Yay!).
