Several months ago I had a list of items that I needed to discuss with Austen, our CEO. I was in the Getaroom app looking to see what was available when I glanced outside and noticed that it was a gorgeous sunny San Francisco fall day. All of a sudden the thought of sitting in a windowless conference room sounded very unappealing. I looked at my list of items and realized that there wasn’t anything that needed a computer so I put the meeting on the calendar and in location I wrote “Walk and Talk”. A few hours later when Austen was looking at his calendar he asked, “Which conference room is ‘Walk and Talk’?”


I explained to him to him that a walking meeting is a meeting that you take on the road. If anything that’s being discussed doesn’t need a whiteboard, computer, or conference room then it is the perfect candidate for a walking meeting. Ideally, walking meetings take place outdoors where team members can benefit from fresh air and sunshine, but walking around a large office can work too. Austen was immediately on board and walking meetings have since become a core meeting style at Serverless. If it doesn’t involve a computer then get to walking!


The best way to implement walking meetings at your office is to just start scheduling them on the calendar with your coworkers. You may even scope out a nice 30 minute route that you can take around campus or on the block so that you aren’t spending precious decision making energy determining the next turn (although I find this to be one of the joys of a walking meeting). If you are met with some confusion and resistance you can share these four reasons why walking meetings are amazing.

####**1. Boosts creativity**
It’s easy to find yourself thinking inside of the proverbial box when you are sitting in a literal box all day long. Two researchers at Stanford University found a strong correlation between walking and being more creative. Their [2014 study](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/xlm-a0036577.pdf) reported that participants who walked while thinking of a problem were almost 70% more creative than those who just sat calmly while trying to solve a set of problems.


####**2. Builds team camaraderie**
Shared experiences are the foundation of building trust between coworkers. By taking a meeting on the road and breaking out of the office environment your meeting is now an adventure that the two (or more) of you are on together. Participating regularly in walking meetings in San Francisco has taught me that a lot can happen in a 30 minute jaunt around the block. By navigating construction, street lights, and other pedestrians, my colleagues and I have to make decisions about our route and do some minor problem solving in the moment. Having these “micro-accomplishments” in a low stakes environment creates an element of trust for bigger projects that have more on the line.


####**3. Eases the way for difficult conversations**
Think back to the last time you were on the receiving end of a difficult conversation. When the person broached the difficult topic did you feel your heart beat faster, your blood run cold, or your hands start to feel clammy? Those are all normal indicators of an acute stress response (aka fight or flight). When our body senses acute stress it goes into survival mode, which dumps adrenaline and cortisol into our system, shuts down our prefrontal cortex (which is where all of our reasoning and higher thought happens), and fires up our limbic system (aka lizard brain). When a person is in the state of fight or flight it’s very difficult to have a meaningful conversation because they are on the defensive and not thinking rationally.


Walking during a difficult conversation helps alleviate a lot of the symptoms of acute stress. Moving around makes it easier for the body to process the adrenaline and cortisol that just got dumped into its system, making it easier for the person to relax. It’s also a lot easier to talk about sensitive subjects when both parties are sitting across a table staring at each other feeling trapped.


####**4. Makes people healthy and happier**
[Exercising 15 minutes a day can increase a person’s lifespan by 3 years.](http://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/exercise-15-minutes-a-day-ups-lifespan-by-3-years) The average person burns about 128 calories on a 30 minute walk compared to about 36 calories burned when sitting at a desk for 30 minutes. That’s a big difference! If you did a few walking meetings a week that adds up to some serious opportunity for weight loss and heart health. Walking also releases chemicals into our bodies, such as endorphins, which help give us a [mood boost and mental clarity for several hours following exercise](http://birdeemag.com/this-is-your-brain-after-walking/). So if you want to work with happy people invite them walking!
