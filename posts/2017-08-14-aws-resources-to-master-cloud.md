From a newbie's perspective, there is a lot happening inside of AWS. At the time of writing this post, there are **over 74 different products** in the AWS admin console. SEVENTY-FOUR. Where to start?

In this post, I'll highlight resources I wish I knew existed when diving into the world of AWS. (in no particular order)

### 1. [Amazon Web Services in Plain English](https://www.expeditedssl.com/aws-in-plain-english)

I'm a huge fan of explaining things in a clear, concise way. Too many tutorials either beat around the bush, or come loaded down with industry jargon.

Amazon Web Services in Plain English takes a no-nonsense approach to making AWS product offerings manageable and understandable.

### 2. [Open Guides - AWS](https://github.com/open-guides/og-aws)

A boon of trustworthy and practical information and recommendations for a slew of AWS services

Shoutout to https://twitter.com/brianleroux for pointing out this resource to me.

### 3. [A Cloud Guru](https://acloud.guru/)

A cloud guru is a vast library of cloud training material.

Want to learn about AWS services? They got it.

Want to learn about Serverless? They got it.

Want to learn about DynamoDB? They have a freaking 23 hour course on it!

If you enjoy learning via video, I'd highly recommend checking them out.

### 4. [Cloud Academy](https://cloudacademy.com/learning-paths/)

[![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.site.serverless.com/blog/aws-resources-post/media_1502238876113.jpg "media_1502238876113.jpg")](https://cloudacademy.com/learning-paths/)

Cloud academy offers a ton of top notch video content as well, with a range of learning paths to take you from AWS newbie to AWS Neo.

### 5. [Alfred AWS docs](https://github.com/SamVerschueren/alfred-aws)

Alfred is one of my favorite productivity apps. This Alfred plugin is super handy for having the AWS docs literally right at your fingertips.

I use this all the time when I am working with a particular AWS sdk and can't remember all the methods avialable to me.
