We're compiled an open-source GitHub repo of [all the cloud and serverless conferences happening in 2019](https://github.com/serverless/cloud-computing-conferences), no matter where you are on the globe. (See one missing? Submit a PR!)

Conferences are a great chance to network and learn about how others are using the cloud day-to-day. But you can't hit all of them.

So if you're trying to narrow down your list, here's where you should look first. These are our top picks for 2019.
