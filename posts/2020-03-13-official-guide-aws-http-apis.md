# The Official Guide to AWS HTTP APIs

We've already discussed AWS HTTP APIs in the past few weeks, but there's a lot to learn. So we decided to create [The Official Guide to AWS HTTP APIs](https://serverless.com/aws-http-apis) - a comprehensive guide that we will keep updated with all the latest best practices and how to use HTTP APIs with the Serverless Framework. This guide will follow the same format as our existing guides like the ones on the [API Gateway](https://serverless.com/amazon-api-gateway/), [DynamoDB](https://serverless.com/dynamodb/), and [Lambda](https://serverless.com/aws-lambda/).

As we develop it, we want to hear from you! What examples and use cases do you want us to include? What remaining questions do you have for us given our previews guides and integration with the AWS HTTP APIs? What do you want to see us change? Let us know in the comments below! As things change, keep an eye out for blog announcements here and updates to the guide!
