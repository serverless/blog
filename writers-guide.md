## Choosing A Topic

1.  Find the ongoing list of ideas and schedule in the <span class="c5 c10">[Content Calendar in Asana](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://app.asana.com/0/173140658754685/206747580911378&sa=D&ust=1481063994397000&usg=AFQjCNHuy4Sb66K5avepG3zVg8TXqSfqrQ). The Serverless team gets first choice on writing topics, then we turn to guest authors. Posts are scheduled 1-6 weeks in advance.
2.  Heart your top 2 choices for the posts you’d like to write in Asana. Feel free to add a topic to the list and heart it instead of choosing from the list. Stefanie will follow up to create a timeline for a draft and final post that works with your schedule.

## Creating an Outline

It’s helpful to organize your ideas in an outline before you start writing. Your outline will depend on what type of post you’re writing, but here are a few prompts you can follow to help you get started.

Note: These are just suggestions. Feel free to amend to fit your needs.

### Generic Outline

*   Introduction - What are you writing about and why? Tell the reader what they can expect to learn or gain if they continue reading. Be clear and concise. This is your chance to convince the reader that it’s worth their time to keep going.
*   Body - Divide into sections that make sense. You can divide the body into paragraphs, steps, phases, or a list. Adding subheadings helps to break up the content and makes it easier for readers to scan your content.
*   Conclusion - Tie everything together by recapping what you’ve talked about and sharing any relevant next steps. This would also be a great place to include any additional related resources you’d like to share.

### Writing about a Project

*   What problem did you set out to solve with your project?
*   What was the benefit of using serverless architecture?
*   Walk us through your process and architecture, including code.
*   Share any relevant lessons learned.
*   Share your vision for the future of your project/next steps.
*   Feel free to include anything else you think is useful/relevant for the post.

### How-To Post

*   Introduction - What will readers be able to accomplish after reading this post? What makes you a credible source of information about this topic? (i.e., a core framework developer writing about a new feature, or the operations manager writing about the lean startup method)
*   Steps - Break your process down into individual steps that are clearly labeled. Each step should be one complete thought or action. Include relevant screenshots or code snippets as needed.
*   Conclusion - Recap your process and include any relevant next steps or additional resources.

### Event Recap

*   Introduction - Provide background info on the event. What is it?
*   Lessons Learned - Write a list of Lessons Learned or Takeaways from your experience at the event.
*   Conclusion - What are you going to do with these takeaways? How can readers use this information to their benefit?
